    such as when openjdk isn't installed.

    and build-indep run concurrently, we relink a library while it's being
    used; that doesn't work so well).

protobuf (2.0.3-2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.

    packages.  Move openjdk to Build-Depends-Indep.  This should allow
    building on hppa, which doesn't have openjdk.  Based on a patch by Sune
    Vuorela (but any bugs are mine).
